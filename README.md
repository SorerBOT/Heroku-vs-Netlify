# Static vs Dynamic websites:

## Static:  

* Can respond to user interactions. (button clicks, hover effects and the likes...)  
* Can't interact with databases. (The data can't be mutated - hence they are called static...)

* Interacts with databases. (The data can be mutated - hence they are called dynamic.)

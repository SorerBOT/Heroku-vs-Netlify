# Heroku vs Netlify:

To begin with, we must learn to differenciate between Static and Dynamic websites:

## Static:  

* Can respond to user interactions. (button clicks, hover effects and the likes...)  
* Can't interact with databases. (The data can't be mutated - hence they are called static...)

## Dynamic:

* Can respond to user interactions. (button clicks, hover effects and the likes...)  
* Interacts with databases. (The data can be mutated - hence they are called dynamic.)
